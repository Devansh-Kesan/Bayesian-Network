Bayesian Network and Inference Algorithms

This Python script provides functionalities to work with Bayesian Networks and perform inference using two methods: Variable Elimination and Rejection Sampling.

You can use this script to read Bayesian network specifications and queries from files and compute probabilities based on those queries.

To run the script, provide the Bayesian network file path and the query file path as command line arguments.

python3 bayesian_inference.py <bayesian_network_file> <query_file>

For Example :
python3 bayesian_inference.py b1.txt q1.txt

Note :
The query file and bayesian network file should be in the same directory as of bayesian_inference.py
